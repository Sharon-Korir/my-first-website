  <p>My pet's name is Roman. He is a three month old GSD whom I adopted from KSPCA. 
    He is very playful but wary of strangers.</p>
  <p>Roman's favorite activities include;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>chasing his own tail</li>
    <li>barking at the door</li>
    <li>chewing my shoes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Roman's favorite toy is my pair  of crocs. He owns a ball but he doesn't quite get the concept of <i>fetch</i>. Ever since I fot Roman, he has managed to;</p>
